# Challenge
# ask the user to input 2 numbers, then print the sum and difference of those numbers

# This is an empty list
nums = []

# This for loop should repeat twice, taking in a number each time and saving it into our list
for i in range(2):
    number = int(input("Please enter a number"))
    nums.append(number)


# new challenge: using the new code, find the sum of all the numbers in the list
# Part 2: Find the average of the list 
print(nums)
